# Brief 


Text summarization is the process of generating a short, fluent, and most importantly accurate summary of a respectively longer text document. The main idea behind our system is to be able to find a summarized text within the given limited lines from 7 different types of text sources e.g. raw text, audio, video, pdf, doc, image or URL and present it in a human-readable format. At the same time, providing people with other facilities e.g. entity checking, finding text type [private, business, etc], learning the key wordâ€™s meaning with various information e.g. tag, sentiment, lemma, shape, dependency, etc. As online textual data grows, automatic text summarization and entity checking methods have potential to be very helpful because more useful information can be read in a short time. 


In a recent advance, the significance of text summarization accomplishes more attention due to data inundation on the web. Hence this information overwhelms yields in the big requirement for more reliable and capable progressive text summarizers. Text Summarization gains its importance due to its various types of applications just like the summaries of books, digest- (summary of stories), the stock market, news, Highlights- (meeting, event, sport), Abstract of scientific papers, newspaper articles, magazine etc.


Text summarization has grown into a crucial and appropriate engine for supporting and illustrating text content in the latest speedy emergent information age. It's very complex for humans to physically summarize oversized documents of text. There is a wealth of textual content available on the internet. The main advantage of our text summarization is that the reading time of the user can be reduced. Our system has reproduced the assorted theme of any document even as keeping repetition to a minimum.


The objective of automatic text summarization is to condense the origin text into a precise version that preserves its report content and global denotation. An extractive summarization technique consists of selecting vital sentences, paragraphs, etc, from the original manuscript and concatenating them into a shorter form. The significance of sentences is strongly based on statistical and linguistic features of sentences. 


Following this goal, we have developed an NLP model for text summarization and create an end to end web application which can take any raw text, audio, video, pdf/doc, image or URL as input and then, check the line limitation given by the user and finally, generate 4 different summaries from 4 different summarizers to provide the comparison facilities. Entity checker, 4 different text classifiers and word details checker have also provided the best version of Text Summarizer And Entity checker for users from any background.
